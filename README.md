# ZipLearn #
This software currently has almost no functionality

It's a webapp for dynamically presenting classroom content with interactive possiblities for the students. I wanted to use a webapp to empower students and the one leading the class to be more involved and deliver or receive content in the most time-appropriate manner possible. The idea is to have presentations which are controlled by the class leader's mobile device and to have instant polls for the students to participate in via their own mobile devices.


## Technical structure ##
This version of ZipLearn uses Meteor with the streams plugin. The presentations are powered by Reveal.js.


## Install ##
This being a meteor app, you'll need to have node.js and meteor installed.
